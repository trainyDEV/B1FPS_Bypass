# Bloons TD Battles 1 FPS unlock

BTD Battles 1 FPS Unlocker made for Steam 

Special thanks to lerno for help with the program itself. (me bad c#) <3

Special thanks to [@Walter-o](https://github.com/Walter-o/) whose [Steam post](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2582279385) inspired me to create this.

Usage:
- While Battles 1 is open, set desired fps cap.


Note:
- Your FPS will not go above your refresh rate anyway (idk vsync bullshit)
- FPS interval you can set to is 60-600 on the release branches.
- This tool directly modifies memory while you're ingame, it shouldn't be bannable but use at your own risk.
